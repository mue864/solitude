- Use listeners to sync data whenever session ends or settings change
- Handle network edge cases (sync queue for offline mode)

---

### 🧪 Version

- **Tag:** `Data Safety & Portability`
- **Planned For:** `v1.5`
- **Status:** Core design ready, implementation requires setup of backend

feature 7
---

### 📌 Description

Activating this mode triggers **system-wide “Do Not Disturb”**, optionally **locks the screen into Pomoflow**, and **blocks distractions** (apps, notifications, etc.) during a work session.

---

### 🔥 Why It's Crucial

- Protects the user’s mental space during deep work
- Keeps distractions out (especially phone notifications and mindless app-switching)
- Acts like a digital “safe room” for focused tasks

---

### 🧠 Behavior

| Component | Function |
| --- | --- |
| 📴 Do Not Disturb | Enables system DND on session start, disables on end |
| 🧱 App Lockdown (Optional) | Prevents switching to blacklisted apps during session |
| ⏲️ Lock-In Mode | Timer must finish or be force-exited to regain access |
| 🚫 Notification Blocking | Silently handles all alerts, optional exceptions (e.g. calls) |
- Ask for permission once and reuse
- Enable via session settings or “Quick Start”

---

### 🖼️ UI Ideas

- ⚠️ Prompt: “Activate Deep Focus?” → user confirms
- 🔒 Lock-screen-like session UI with countdown only
- ✋ Exit confirmation required during focus to prevent accidental exits
- 👁️ Simple progress ring with no distractions

---

### ⚙️ Tech Notes (React Native)

- 🔧 For DND: Use `react-native-do-not-disturb` or custom Android/iOS permissions
- 🛡️ For lockdown: Use Android’s `Screen Pinning` or iOS `Guided Access` equivalents
- ❌ App blocking needs Android native code, or use a whitelist launcher (Android only)
- Might need to notify user if feature isn't available on their OS version

---
